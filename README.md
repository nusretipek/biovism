## Working with Git and GitHub


If have no working knowledge of Git at commandline, then I suggest you to go over [Git in 2 Minutes](https://www.garyrobinson.net/2014/10/git-in-two-minutes-for-a-solo-developer.html) and [Git in 5 Minutes](https://classic.scottr.org/presentations/git-in-5-minutes/). Note that you might need to still search [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) for specific tasks. <br /><br />

**Step 1.** Fork this repository (via web browser or Github CLI) / clone using the above command (Git Bash)<br />
**Step 2.** Make changes locally and push to your origin (Git Bash or Github CLI)<br />
**Step 3.** Create a pull request to merge with the main project repository (via Git Bash, Github CLI or web broweser) <br /><br />

**Note:** *The network drives are only accesible by Jan Verwaeren; all pull requests need to be pushed by moderators* <br />
