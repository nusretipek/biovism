<p align="justify" style="font-size:18px;"><b> Maarten Perneel </b> is a PhD student in Bioscience Engineering and has a strong background in plant-sciences, animal-sciences and machine learning. During his current research, he focusses on behaviour monitoring of dairy cattle by using a computer vision based pipeline. Therefore, he developed various models to detect animals, identify them and classify their behaviour accurately. </p>
